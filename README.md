# What is Hedera Heroes? ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Hedera Heroes is an effort to encourage developer community collaboration by rewarding you for sharing lessons learned, how-to tutorials, and other articles on the  <a href="https://www.hedera.com/blog/">Hedera blog</a>. In return, you'll receive a minimum of $100 worth of hbar for each post. 

# What can I write about? ‚úçÔ∏è
Whatever you like, as long as it is helpful for other developers. Topics can range from more theoretical architectures to how to use Hedera File Service to manage credential checks with Java. Check out this <a href="https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-heroes/issues">repository's issues for topics</a> we're looking for and ideas to get inspired by. 

In short, if another developer would find it helpful you should likely write about it.
